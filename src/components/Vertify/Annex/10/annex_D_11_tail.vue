    Actuating motor works according to electric power supplied by driver's operation of headlamp leveling device switch. Worm and worm gear change the rotating power of the actuating motor into linear movement which pushes and pulls the device shaft. The shaft, linked with the reflector, moves forward and backward. Then the reflector of the headlamp can rotate up and down around the pivot. The more the reflector turns downward the bigger the downward-inclination of dipped-beam, and vice versa. So, when driver rotates the switch to downward, the reflector of the lamp turns downward around the pivot. If the driver turns it to the opposite direction the reflector moves upward around the pivot.
